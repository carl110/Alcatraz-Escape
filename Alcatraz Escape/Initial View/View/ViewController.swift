The three men were able to escape from their cells and leave the island in a makeshift raft. It remains unknown what happened to them after entering San Francisco Bay. A fourth inmate, Allen West, did not manage to escape his cell in time to join the others and decided to abort his escape attempt. The escape was marked by elaborate planning and execution, including crafting dummy heads to fool the guards, making of improvised tools and of a raft.\n\nIn 1979, the FBI officially closed their investigation, concluding that the men drowned in the frigid waters of San Francisco Bay while trying to reach land. The U.S. Marshals Service continues the investigation, keeping the escapees on its wanted list. New circumstantial and material evidence continues to surface up, stoking further research and debates on whether the inmates managed to survive. \n\n\n\n\n NOW ITS YOUR TURN...\n\n\n\n"
